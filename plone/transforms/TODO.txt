TODO
====

    - Add more metadata to the results. For example the image mimetypes for all
      images extracted by a transform.

    - When passing in a file instance instead of just an iterator to the
      transform method, reuse the file directly in binary transforms, instead
      of writing it out to a tempfile.

    - Port the xslt base transform class.

    - Write an iterator based version of the html_bodyfinder, so the pdf to
      html transforms don't need to load the whole file into memory.
      Use reversed(iter) (needs __len__ and __getitem__) for the html
      bodyfinder? Or collections.deque which has both leftpop and rightpop.

    - Make the configuration screen for the engine.

    - Add an example of a TTW configurable transform and provide a base helper
      class for those (probably schema and formlib-based).

    - Figure out a way to use a NamedTemporayFile or 'NamedTemporayDirectory'
      for returning subobjects, so these don't need to be loaded into memory.
      Some self cleaning temporary directory (on close and garbage collection)
      would be nice.

    - Make a new plone.app.transforms package which has GenericSetup export/
      import handlers for the engine configuration.

    - Port and make more transforms ;)

      Here's the current list of transforms only available in PortalTransforms
      right now:

        office_com
        office_uno
        office_wvware
        rtf_to_html
        rtf_to_xml
        safe_html
        build_transforms
        xml

    - Look into textindexng, smartprintng, AROfficeTransforms, AttachmentField
      for more or more clever transforms.

    - Make a decorator for the _validate call, so:

        def transform(self, data, options=None):
            if self._validate(data) is None:
                return None
            return TransformResult(data)

      becomes:

        @validate_input
        def transform(self, data, options=None):
            return TransformResult(data)

      and raise the log level for invalid input from debug to warn.

Not directly package related tasks
----------------------------------

    - Make PortalTransforms into a wrapper around plone.transforms and use it
      directly from Archetypes.

    - Port the Unicode aware cStringIO from Python 3.0 back into a separate
      package and use it in stringiter?
