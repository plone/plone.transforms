TODO
====

    - Write more tests for the engine. Check the use_ranked vs. not use_ranked
      behavior.

    - Write tests for web.intelligenttext!

    - Port the xslt base transform class.

    - Write an iterator based version of the html_bodyfinder, so the pdf to
      html transforms don't need to load the whole file into memory.

    - Use reversed(iter) (needs __len__ and __getitem__) for the html
      bodyfinder? Or collections.deque which has both leftpop and rightpop.

    - Make the configuration screen for the engine.

    - Add an example of a TTW configurable transform and provide a base helper
      class for those (probably schema and formlib-based).

    - Figure out a way to use a NamedTemporayFile or 'NamedTemporayDirectory'
      for returning subobjects, so these don't need to be loaded into memory.
      Some self cleaning temporary directory (on close and garbage collection)
      would be nice.

    - Reconsider passing a desired filename argument to the command transforms,
      make the infile_data_suffix argument more clever or powerful.

    - Make a new plone.app.transforms package which has GenericSetup export/
      import handlers for the engine configuration.

    - Re-evaluate security settings.

    - Port and make more transforms ;)

      Here's the current list of transforms only available in PortalTransforms
      right now:

        lynx_dump
        office_com
        office_uno
        office_wvware
        python
        rest
        rtf_to_html
        rtf_to_xml
        safe_html
        st (aka structuredtext)
        text_pre_to_html
        text_to_html
        build_transforms
        xml

Not directly package related tasks
----------------------------------

    - Make PortalTransforms into a wrapper around plone.transforms and use it
      directly from Archetypes.
